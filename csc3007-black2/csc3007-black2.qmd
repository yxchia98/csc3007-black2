# Relationship between nation's legal framework achievements in gender equality and woman's success in the economy.

## Purpose of This Presentation

In a report published by the International Monetary Fund titled "Tackling Legal Impediments to Women's Economic Empowerment"[^1] 2022, The report highlighted how legal framework has help improve woman's success in the economy of various countries such as Iceland, Peru & Rwanda.

[^1]: Christopherson Puh, K. M., Yiadom, A., Johnson, J., Fernando, F., Yazid, H., & Thiemann, C. (2022). Tackling Legal Impediments to Women's Economic Empowerment, IMF Working Papers, 2022(037), A001. Retrieved Jul 19, 2023, from https://doi.org/10.5089/9798400203640.001.A001

## Purpose of This Presentation

This presentation thus aims to explore the relationship between nation's legal framework achievements in gender equality and woman's success in the economy. offering insights into the significance of legal framework in gender equality and woman's status in a country economy.

## Research Questions

To what extent does a nation's legal framework on gender equality affect economic growth for women?

Specifically, what is the relationship between a [nation's legal framework achievements in gender equality]{.underline} and [woman's success in the economy]{.underline}?

Can [GDP]{.underline}, [Happy Planet Index Score]{.underline} and [Continent]{.underline} serve as predictors for a nation's legal framework achievements in gender equality & proportion of women in managerial positions?

## Importance of This Research

-   Economic empowerment:

The economic empowerment of women has broader implications for overall economic development.

-   Policy formulation:

Inform policymakers and lawmakers about the effectiveness and relevance of legal frameworks in fostering economic growth for women.

## Importance of This Research

-   Gender equality:

The impact of these legal frameworks is crucial in advancing gender equality efforts.

-   Societal impact:

Sheds light on the potential benefits and consequences of legal frameworks on economic growth, impacting woman's lives and opportunities.

## UN Sustainable Development Goals

Women participation in the economy is related to Goals 5 and 8.

## Selected Indicators

**Indicator 5.1.1**: Legal frameworks that promote, enforce and monitor gender equality (percentage of achievement 0 - 100) \-- Area 3: employment and economic benefits

**Indicator 5.5.2:** Proportion of women in managerial positions

**Indicator 8.5.1:** Average hourly earnings of employees by sex, age, occupation and persons with disabilities

**Indicator 8.5.2:** Unemployment rate by sex, age and persons with disabilities

## Anticipation of the effect of Legal Gender Equality Frameworks on Women in Managerial Positions

We anticipate that the higher the nation's legal framework achievements in gender equality will result in a higher percentage of women holding managerial positions.

-   Because the chance of gender-based discrimination should be reduced as a result of the legal frameworks in place, this should result in better opportunities for women to hold managerial positions.

## Effect of Legal Gender Equality Frameworks on Women in Managerial Positions

<small>There seem to be a moderate correlation between the percentage of achievement in legal employment and benefit frameworks for females, and the percentage of woman in managerial position.

## EFFECTS OF UNEMPLOYMENT RATES ON HOURLY EARNINGS FOR WOMEN re-expressed

::: columns
::: {.column width="40%"}
<small> The average hourly earnings for women is re-expressed by taking the squared root of the skewed values while the unemployed rates is re-expressed by taking log10 of the skewed values. This helps to reduce the impact of extreme values and make the distribution more symmetrical. This resulted in an insignificant correlation value increase by 0.103, with a correlation that is very close to zero, indicating that there is virtually no relationship between them.</small>

## Anticipation of what Extensive Gender Equality Frameworks does to Female Unemployment

We anticipate that having a higher the nation's legal framework achievements in gender equality would result in lower unemployment rate for women.

-   Because by decreasing gender discrimination for women, more companies would be willing to employ women.

# Step 5: Get Relative Importance
relative_importance <- vector(length = length(tree$variable.importance))
for (i in 1:length(tree$variable.importance)) {
  relative_importance[i] <- tree$variable.importance[i] / tree$variable.importance[1]
}
relative_importance
```

Ten-fold cross validation indicates that the decision tree has a low accuracy of `r model$results$Accuracy`

The relative importance of the predictors for classification are as follows:

-   HPI: `r relative_importance[1]`
-   Continent: `r relative_importance[2]`
-   GDP size: `r relative_importance[3]`

## Summary of Quantitative Results

-   Moderate correlation between same-goal indicators.
-   Moderate correlation between legal employment and benefit frameworks for females and the representation of women in managerial positions.
-   Little correlations of statistical significance are observed between indicators for different goals.
-   Potentially influenced by the country's originally high unemployment rates across all genders.
-   Missing data for significant countries such as Russia and China.
