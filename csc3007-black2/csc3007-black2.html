<h2><strong>5.1.1 vs 5.5.2 Anticipation</strong></h2>
<p>We anticipate that the higher the nation’s legal framework achievements in gender equality will result in a higher percentage of women holding managerial positions.</p>
<ul>
<li>Because the chance of gender-based discrimination should be reduced as a result of the legal frameworks in place, this should result in better opportunities for women to hold managerial positions.</li>
